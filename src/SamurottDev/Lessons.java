				"System.out.println(\"Hello World\");",
				"Hello World",
				"Neat! You just typed your first Java command! Here's a quick breakdown of what that means:",
				"First, what is 'System.out.println'? 'System' is a CLASS, or a group of commands.",
				"'out' is a SUBCLASS of 'System', which is a class under another class, or owned by another class",
				"Subsequently, 'println' is a COMMAND of 'out', which prints text to the CONSOLE, which is this box!",
				"The STRING \"Hello World\" is a list of text characters making up the phrase 'Hello World'.",
				"That string is an ARGUMENT to the 'println' command, which is the thing displayed in the console.",
				"Finally, every command ends with a SEMICOLON: ';'.",
				"Semicolons are a way to tell Java where one command ends and another begins.",
				"That is a LOT to take in, and these terms will appear throughout all of these lessons...",
				"...so, it's your turn! Create a new Java project, and play with the println command!"));
